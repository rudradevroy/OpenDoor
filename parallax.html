Open Door is an environment in which one finds the experience of learning. We all learn, sooner or later, that only our own life experience will ever be our teacher; words don’t teach. So, I hope that this environment which we are in the process of creating will allow individuals to experience their own life in it, with it, and through it.</p>
            
<p class="side-text">Open Door is to be a free school. Since we are basing our work on the premise of equality, no learner on campus is required to pay fees however affluent or non-affluent they are. Donations are allowed and will be accepted as per the legal framework within which the Trust operates. No member of the Trust or the organization is eligible to accept any donation in his or her personal name.</p>
            
<p class="side-text">Open Door is not especially a school for the ‘underprivileged’. It is time we gave up these labels. The wonderful thing about human existence in this time and space reality is that we come into diversity, we live a multi-faceted experience, and we expand because this diversity exists both in our environment and within the self. What keeps us stuck in one particular state of existence – rich or poor, sick or well, lazy or energetic, stupid or intelligent, powerless or free – is our own limited human mind with its badly trained perspectives. The education we offer should be able to lift up this limitation and allow people to return to their natural state of diverse abundance. Open Door is available to all who are interested in this learning.</p>
