        <h2> About the fundraiser </h2>
          <p>Open Door Learning is a non profit which runs two free schools in Bangalore and Kolkata. Our teachers are human beings first and they are reminded of this on a regular basis. They are the clarity they want their students to embody. Each teacher is required to be proficient enough in their respective subjects as to publish their own text books. Each classroom has a maximum for twenty students. Our students are divided into classes based on the year they join, there is no age restriction or limit. Even though our students are dubbed "underprivileged" by society, they represent some of the brightest and lively young minds. 
Our goal is to open two campuses: one in Bangalore and kolkata which can house all these kids.
