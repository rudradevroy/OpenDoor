<h1> 3 minute pitch </h1>
<p>



Ideas are the building blocks of knowledge and progress. We all have ideas but seldom find the stage to present them. At open floor, the 3-minute pitch session (names are tentative) is the opportunity to do just that. The floor is open to anyone to share the one thought or compelling idea that can spark interest and trigger change. 
            Each speaker is given 3 to 5 minutes, during which no holes are barred. There are no limitations to topic, presentation, or degree of interaction. Everything is for the speaker to decide. Volunteers will be decided at the event itself so that nobody is left out. The stage is open to anyone and everyone.
